\textit{
Attitudes towards corruption may be a strong determinant of its incidence. Using survey
data from the AmericasBarometer (AB), binary-outcome empirical models are estimated to discover
the key determinants of an increase in corruption tolerance in Ecuador between 2014 and
2016. It is found that two key variables may have influenced this increase. People who approved
of the Presidentâ€™s job performance initially justified bribes less, but by 2016 supporters started to
justify corruption more. Also, those that identified closer to the political right started to justify corruption more in 2016. The jump is explained through these variables as the percentage of people
who approved of the President decreased and the percentage of people identifying with the right
increased. It is also found that the people who were either employed or outside the labor force
justified bribes more in 2016 when compared to those who were unemployed.}
